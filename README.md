### These are some of the unofficial demos used for tutorials and presentations

### Demos

These code snippets below are intended to supplement and give a glimpse of how to implement some concepts and solutions.

So, you're encouraged you to use your critical thinking skills while exploring these demos as there might be some faster/better ways to implement these concepts and might differ slightly.

Spot any errors or have any suggestions? Feel free to share them by opening an issue :\)

#### Week 3

- [Binary Search (Recursive)](./BinarySearch.java)

#### Week 4

- [Recursive Insertion Sort](./RecursiveInsertionSort.java)
- [Stack with an array](./StackWithArray.java)
- [Iterative Merge Sort](./IterativeMergeSort.java) (Similar idea for sorting a queue with another queue)

(Nothing for week 5)

#### Week 6

- [DFS and BFS Recursive and Iterative](./Search.java)
- [Pre-Order to BST](./preOrderToBST.java)
- [Height of Binary Tree](./Tree.java), O(n + m)
- [TreeNode (To make nodes for above codes)](./TreeNode.java)
